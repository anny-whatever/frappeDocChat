Frappe ships with an HTTP API that can be classified into Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), to call whitelisted methods and Representational State Transfer (REST), to manipulate resources.

The base URL is https://{your frappe instance}. Every request shown here should be added to the end of your base URL. For example, if your instance is demo.erpnext.com, GET /api/resource/User means GET https://demo.erpnext.com/api/resource/User.

API v1

All v1 API endpoints are prefixed with /api/. Starting from Frappe Framework version 15, they can instead be prefixed with /api/v1/.

RPC

A request to an endpoint /api/method/dotted.path.to.method will call a whitelisted python method.

For example, GET /api/method/frappe.auth.get_logged_user will call this function from frappe's auth module:

@frappe.whitelist()
def get_logged_user():
 return frappe.session.user

Response:

{
 "message": "Administrator"
}

REST

All documents in Frappe are available via a RESTful API with prefix /api/resource/. You can perform all CRUD operations on them:

Create

You can create a document by sending a POST request to the endpoint, /api/resource/{doctype}.
Read

You can get a document by its name using the endpoint, /api/resource/{doctype}/{name}
Update

You can update a document by sending a PUT request to the endpoint, /api/resource/{doctype}/{name}. This acts like a PATCH HTTP request in which you do not have to send the whole document but only the parts you want to change.
Delete

You can delete a document by its name by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint, /api/resource/{doctype}/{name}.

API v2

 API v2 is available starting from Frappe Framework v15

All v2 API endpoints are prefixed with /api/v2/.

RPC v2

Similar to v1, RPC endpoints are available at /api/v2/method/ prefix. The following endpoints are available:

/api/v2/method/login - Handle user login (implicit)
/api/v2/method/logout - Log out current user
/api/v2/method/ping - Check server status
/api/v2/method/upload_file - Upload a file
/api/v2/method/dotted.path.to.method - Call any whitelisted method
/api/v2/method/<doctype>/<method> - Call whitelisted method from doctype controller
/api/v2/method/run_doc_method - Run a whitelisted method on a document

REST v2

API v2 provides a more RESTful interface with the prefix /api/v2/document/ and /api/v2/doctype/. The following operations are supported:

Document Operations

Create

Create a document by sending a POST request to /api/v2/document/{doctype}
