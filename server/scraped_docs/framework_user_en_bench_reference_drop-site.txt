Usage

bench drop-site [OPTIONS] SITE

Description

Drop an existing site. In this operation, the database is dropped and the
respective site's folder is moved from ./sites to ./archived_sites (unless
specified otherwise) on your Bench. A full site backup is taken prior to this.

Options

--db-root-username Username for a DBMS user with drop database privileges.
Defaults to root
--db-root-password Password for the DBMS user
--archived-sites-path Specify the path to move the site's folder in

Flags

--no-backup Skip backup prior to site drop
--force Force drop-site even if an error is encountered

Examples

Skip the interactive prompt by passing the root password.

bench drop-site {site} --db-root-password {db-root-pass}

Skip taking a backup before site deletion.

bench drop-site {site} --no-backup

Move the site's folder in a different folder instead of the standard
./archived_sites.

bench drop-site {site} --archived-sites-path {path/to/archive}
