  "content": "In case where a code and a name is maintained for an entity, (for example for Employee there may be an Employee Code and Employee Name) and we want to show both the ID and name in a link field, we can make a formatter.\n\nExample:\n\nfrappe.form.link_formatters['Employee'] = function(value, doc) {\n if(doc.employee_name && doc.employee_name !== value) {\n return value + ': ' + doc.employee_name;\n } else {\n return value;\n }\n}\n\nNotes:\n\nBoth the primary key (name) and the descriptive name (e.g. employee_name) must be present in the document. The descriptive name field could be hidden\nThis needs to be loaded before the document is loaded and can be re-used for all forms. You can also add it in build.json",
