  "content": "DocTypes have a table associated with them. For example DocType Customer will have a table tabCustomer associated with it.\n\nSingle type DocTypes have no table associated and there is only one Document for it. This is similar to the Singleton pattern in Java. Single DocTypes are ideal for saving Settings (that are globally applicable) and for wizard / helper type forms that have no documents, but when the DocType is used for the Form UI.\n\nThe data in Single DocType is stored in tabSingles (doctype, field, value)\n\nExamples\n\nIn Frappe, Single types are System Settings and Customize Form",
