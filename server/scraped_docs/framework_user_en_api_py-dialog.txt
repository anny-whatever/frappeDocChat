Frappe provides a group of standard, interactive and flexible dialogs that are easy to configure and use. There's also a more extensive API for Javascript.

frappe.msgprint

frappe.msgprint(msg, title, raise_exception, as_table, as_list, indicator, primary_action, is_minimizable, wide, realtime)

This method works only within a request / response cycle. It shows a message to the user logged in to Desk who initiated the request.

The argument list includes:

msg: The message to be displayed
title: Title of the modal
as_table: If msg is a list of lists, render as HTML table
as_list: If msg is a list, render as HTML unordered list
primary_action: Bind a primary server/client side action.
raise_exception: Exception
is_wide: Show a wide modal
is_minimizable: Allow users to minimize the modal
realtime: publish immediately using websocket instead of adding to response message log

frappe.msgprint(
 msg='This file does not exist',
 title='Error',
 raise_exception=FileNotFoundError
)

 frappe.msgprint

primary_action can contain a server_action or client_side action which must contain dotted paths to the respective methods. The JavaScript function must be a globally available function. You can also pass hide_on_success to close the message after the action is successfully completed.

# msgprint with server and client side action
frappe.msgprint(msg='This file does not exist',
 title='Error',
 raise_exception=FileNotFoundError
 primary_action={
 'label': _('Perform Action'),
 'server_action': 'dotted.path.to.server.method',
 'client_action': 'dotted.path.to.client.method',
 'hide_on_success': True,
 'args': args
 }
)

 frappe.msgprint with primary action

frappe.throw

frappe.throw(msg, exc, title, is_minimizable, wide, as_list, primary_action)

This method will raise an exception as well as show a message in Desk. It is essentially a wrapper around frappe.msgprint.

exc can be passed an optional exception. By default it will raise a ValidationError exception.

frappe.throw(
 title='Error',
 msg='This file does not exist',
 exc=FileNotFoundError
)
