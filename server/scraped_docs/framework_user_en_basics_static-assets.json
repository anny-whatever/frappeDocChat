  "content": "A guide to understanding how static assets are served in Frappe Framework.\n\nThe assets folder\n\nStatic files are served from the frappe-bench/sites/assets folder. When you\nset up frappe for production deployment, nginx serves this folder directly. All\nstatic file URLs always start with /assets. A file at the location\nfrappe-bench/sites/assets/hero.png is accessible publicly via the URL\n/assets/hero.png.\n\nThe public folder\n\nEvery app has its own public folder which can be used to serve static assets.\nThis folder is symlinked to frappe-bench/sites/assets/[appname]. Here is the\noutput of tree command on the assets folder.\n\n~/frappe-bench\n$ tree sites/assets -L 1\nsites/assets\n├── erpnext -> ~/frappe-bench/apps/erpnext/erpnext/public\n└── frappe -> ~/frappe-bench/apps/frappe/frappe/public\n\nThis means if there is file at [appname]/public/images/favicon.png, then it\nalso exists as a symlink at assets/[appname]/images/favicon.png and is\naccessible publicly via the URL /assets/[appname]/images/favicon.png.\n\nBundled Assets\n\nBundled Assets are generated at\nassets/[appname]/dist/js and assets/[appname]/dist/css. Hence, they are\naccessible via the URL /assets/[appname]/dist/js/main.bundle.[hash].js.\n\nSite Assets\n\nIn addition to static files provided by apps, each site can have its own static\nfiles that might come from user uploads or site backups.\n\nUser uploads\n\nFiles uploaded by user that are public are stored at\nfrappe-bench/sites/[sitename]/public/files. A file stored at\nfrappe-bench/sites/[sitename]/public/files/profile.png is accessible publicly\nvia the URL /files/profile.png\n\nFiles uploaded by user that are private are stored at\nfrappe-bench/sites/[sitename]/private/files. A file stored at\nfrappe-bench/sites/[sitename]/private/files/profile.png is accessible via the\nURL /private/files/profile.png. Private files are accessible only when the\nuser is authorized to view them.\n\nBackups\n\nAny local backups that are generated for the site are stored as\nfrappe-bench/sites/[sitename]/private/backups/20210502_182223-[sitename]-database.sql.gz.\nIt is accessible via the URL\n/backups/20210502_182223-[sitename]-database.sql.gz and only when the user is\nauthorized to download them.\n\nHere is the output of the ls command:\n\n~/frappe-bench\n$ ls -l sites/site1.test/private/backups\ntotal 6160\n-rw-r--r-- 1 farisansari staff 2429268 May 2 18:22 20210502_182223-site1_test-database.sql.gz\n-rw-r--r-- 1 farisansari staff 278 May 2 18:22 20210502_182223-site1_test-site_config_backup.json",
