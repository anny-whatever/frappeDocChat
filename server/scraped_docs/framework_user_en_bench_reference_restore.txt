Usage

bench restore [OPTIONS] SQL_FILE_PATH

Description

Bench CLI can be used to restore an existing site to a previous state. Using the
bench restore command, a site may be restored with the specific database and
file restores. Downgrades aren't supported for Frappe Sites; when a downgrade is
detected, an interactive prompt will pop up before the site restore begins.

The least requirement for performing a restore operation is having the database
file on your local filesystem. The specified path may be relative to the bench
or sites folder, although absolute paths often work best.

The specified database backup file may have the sql.gz or sql extension. For
public and private file backup archives, the default is tar, but since Version
13, compressed archives with the extension tgz are also supported.

 Note: As of this point, there's no way to restore only files using this
 command.

Arguments

SQL_FILE_PATH Path to the database source file. The path may be relative from
the bench directory root, or the sites folder. It may also be an absolute path.
