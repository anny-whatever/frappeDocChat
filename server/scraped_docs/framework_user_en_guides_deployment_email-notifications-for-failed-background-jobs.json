By writing a file, sites/common_site_config.json with content \n\n{\n \"celery_error_emails\": {\n \"ADMINS\": [\n [\n \"Person 1\",\n \"person1@example.com\"\n ],\n [\n \"Person2 \",\n \"person2@example.com\"\n ]\n ],\n \"SERVER_EMAIL\": \"exceptions@example.com\"\n }\n}\n\nOne limitation is that it'll use local mailserver on port 25 to send the emails.",
