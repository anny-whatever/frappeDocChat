Usage

bench migrate-csv-to-po [OPTIONS]

Prerequisites

Please make sure your app has a POT file already. If not, you can generate one.

Description

This command reads in your existing translations from CSV files, matches them with the existing POT file and writes the result into[app_module]/locale/[locale].po.

You will only need this command while switching from the old translation system to the new one.

Options

--app This parameter let's you specify an app, in case you want to migrate translations for one app only. Default: all apps.
--locale This parameter let's you specify a locale, in case you want to migrate translations for one locale only. Default: all locales.

Examples

Migrate ERPNext's german translations from CSV to PO.

bench migrate-csv-to-po --app erpnext --locale de

This reads translations from apps/erpnext/erpnext/translations/de.csv and translatable strings from apps/erpnext/erpnext/locale/main.pot. The result is saved to apps/erpnext/erpnext/locale/de.po. If you're happy with the result, you can now delete the CSV file.
