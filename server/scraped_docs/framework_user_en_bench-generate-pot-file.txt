Usage

bench generate-pot-file [OPTIONS]

Description

This generates a template file for translations, holding all translatable strings of an app (but no translations). The template file will be written to the file [app_module]/locale/main.pot.

For many of our apps, this command is run automatically on a regular basis via GitHub Actions.

Options

--app This parameter let's you specify an app, if you want to generate the POT file for one app only. Default: all apps.

Examples

Re-generate the POT file for ERPNext:

bench generate-pot-file --app erpnext

This will extract all translatable strings from apps/erpnext and write them to apps/erpnext/erpnext/locale/main.pot
