Frappe uses the open-source library Html5-QRCode to provide a flexible way to handle inputs like Barcodes, QRCodes, etc. using the device camera.

frappe.ui.Scanner

new frappe.ui.Scanner({ ... })

Creates a new Scanner instance that can be used to scan single or multiple barcodes.

Options:

container: Dom element under which video feed from the camera will be shown.
dialog: If set as true, will open a dialog to show video feed from the camera.
multiple: If set as false, will stop scanning after one successful scan.
on_scan: Callback method to handle the scanned input.

Here is a sample client code to scan one single barcode and log it to the console.

new frappe.ui.Scanner({
 dialog: true, // open camera scanner in a dialog
 multiple: false, // stop after scanning one value
 on_scan(data) {
 console.log(data.decodedText);
 }
});

The below code can be used to continously scan and handle the scanned input.

const scanner = new frappe.ui.Scanner({
 dialog: true, // open camera scanner in a dialog
 multiple: true, // stop after scanning one value
 on_scan(data) {
 handle_scanned_barcode(data.decodedText);
 }
});

To stop the scanning, you can either close the dialog or use scanner.stop_scan();
