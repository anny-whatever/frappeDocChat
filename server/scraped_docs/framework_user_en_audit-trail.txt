Description

A tool for viewing the changes made to a submittable doctype across multiple amended versions. In a case where a submittable document is cancelled and amended, tracking changes made to the document becomes difficult using the Version doctype since the name of the document changes. Audit Trail can be used to view atmost 5 previously amended versions of a submittable doctype.

Steps

Select the type of the document in the Doctype field.
Select the name of the document in the Document field.
Optionally, select the start and end dates in order to show the amended documents within the specified date range.
Click on the Compare button to view the Audit Trail for the selected document.
