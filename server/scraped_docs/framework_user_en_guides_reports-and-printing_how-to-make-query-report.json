  "content": "You can create tabulated reports using complex SQL queries by creating a new Report. These reports can be created by a System Manager and are stored in the Database\n\n Note: You will need System Manager Permissions for this.\n\nTo create a new Query Report:\n\n1. Create a new Report\n\nSet type as \"Query Report\"\nSet the reference DocType - Users that have access to the reference DocType will have access to the report\nSet the module - The report will appear in the \"Custom Reports\" section of the module.\nAdd your Query\n\n2. Set the Query\n\nYou can define complex queries such as:\n\nSELECT\n tabProduction Order.name as \"Production Order:Link/Production Order:200\",\n tabProduction Order.creation as \"Date:Date:120\",\n tabProduction Order.production_item as \"Item:Link/Item:150\",\n tabProduction Order.qty as \"To Produce:Int:100\",\n tabProduction Order.produced_qty as \"Produced:Int:100\"\n FROM\n tabProduction Order\n WHERE\n tabProduction Order.docstatus=1\n AND ifnull(tabProduction Order.produced_qty,0) = tabProduction Order.qty\n AND EXISTS (SELECT name from tabStock Entry where production_order =tabProduction Order.name)\n\nTo format the columns, set labels for each column in the format: [Label]:[Field Type]/[Options]:[Width]\n\n3. Check the Report\n\n4. Advanced (adding filters)\n\nIf you are making a standard report, you can add filters in your query report just like script reports by adding a .js file in your query report folder. To include filters in your query, use %(filter_key)s where your filter value will be shown.\n\nFor example\n\nSELECT ... FROM ... WHERE item_code = %(item_code)s ORDER BY ...\n\nNote: Standard Script Report\n\nIf you are developing a standard report for an app, make sure to set \"Is Standard\" as \"Yes\"",
