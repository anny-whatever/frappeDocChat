  "content": "WARNING: We DO NOT recommend installing on bare metal servers. Recommend way of setting up production sites is using docker images. You can find instructions here: https://github.com/frappe/frappe#installation\n\nYou can setup the bench for production use by configuring two programs, Supervisor and nginx. If you want to revert your Production Setup to Development Setup refer to these commands\n\nEasy Production Setup\n\nThese steps are automated if you run sudo bench setup production\n\nManual Production Setup\n\nSupervisor\n\nSupervisor makes sure that the process that power the Frappe system keep running and it restarts them if they happen to crash. You can generate the required configuration for supervisor using the command bench setup supervisor. The configuration will be available in config/supervisor.conf directory. You can then copy/link this file to the supervisor config directory and reload it for it to take effect.\n\neg,\n\nbench setup supervisor\nsudo ln -s `pwd`/config/supervisor.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/frappe-bench.conf\n\nNote:\n\nUse --skip-redis option if you do not need to generate config to start redis servers. e.g. bench setup supervisor --skip-redis\nFor CentOS 7, the extension should be ini, thus the command becomes\n\nbench setup supervisor\nsudo ln -s `pwd`/config/supervisor.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/frappe-bench.ini #for CentOS 7 only\n\nThe bench will also need to restart the processes managed by supervisor when you update the apps. To automate this, you will have to setup sudoers using the command, sudo bench setup sudoers $(whoami).\n\nNginx\n\nNginx is a web server and we use it to serve static files and proxy rest of the requests to frappe. You can generate the required configuration for nginx using the command bench setup nginx. The configuration will be available in config/nginx.conf file. You can then copy/link this file to the nginx config directory and reload it for it to take effect.\n\neg,\n\nbench setup nginx\nsudo ln -s `pwd`/config/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/frappe-bench.conf\n\nNote: When you restart nginx after the configuration change, it might fail if you have another configuration with server block as default for port 80 (in most cases for the nginx welcome page). You will have to disable this config. Most probable places for it to exist are /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf and /etc/nginx/conf.d/default. In the latest nginx installs, the file is in /etc/nginx/sites-available/default",
