  "content": "If you are using the same application for multiple site (tenants), each site may want specific customization on top of the DocType. For example if you have a \"Customer\" DocType each user may want addition Custom Fields or naming or other configuration that would be specific to them.\n\nTo allow for site-specific customization, Frappe Framework has multiple approaches\n\nCustom Field: A DocType that keeps track of site-specific fields.\nProperty Setter: This keeps track of specific properties that are overridden in DocType and its children.\nCustomize Form: A view that helps you easily customize DocTypes\nClient Script: Additional client-side event handlers.\nServer Script: Additional server-side business logic.\nCustom DocPerm: Additional Permission (handled via Role Permission Manager)\n\nCustomize Form\n\nCustomize Form is a view that helps you override properties of a DocType and add Custom Fields via a single view.\n\nWhen you change any properties of the DocType via Customize Form, it will not change the underlying DocType but add new custom objects to override those properties. This is done in a seamless manner.\n\nAdding Custom Links and Actions\n\n Added in Version 13\n\nYou can also add / edit Links and Actions via Customize Form. These changes are saved in the same DocTypes (DocType Link and DocType Action) but with a custom property checked.\n\nThese addtional (custom) configurations are automatically applied when metadata is fetched via frappe.get_meta.",
