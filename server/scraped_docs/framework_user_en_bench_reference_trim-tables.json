  "content": "Usage\n\nbench trim-tables [OPTIONS]\n\nDescription\n\nDocfields removed from a particular DocType may not be deleted from their\nDatabase tables. This is by design to prevent premature data loss in Frappe.\nThis won't be problematic for the most part, however, at some point you may face\nissues due to this lingering data.\n\nSome benefits of regular table trimming are:\n\nSmaller backup sizes\nReduced time taken to backup sites\nReduced Site Database Usages\nOptimized queries in case of SELECT *\nDatabase is clean and doesn't have anything hidden or redundant data\n\nThis command modifies the schema of tables in your site's database. It will by default,\ntake a full backup of your entire database before modifying them. In case, these tables\n were modified errenously, you can restore your site to it's original state using\nthe restore command.\n\nOptions\n\n--format, -f Set output format. Available options are JSON and TEXT.\nDefaults to TEXT.\n\nFlags\n\n--dry-run Show what would be deleted\n--no-backup Do not backup the site. This is not recommended since this is a\ndestructive operation.\n\nExamples\n\nThere maybe a lot of lingering columns taking up the space. Perhaps you figured this out\nwhen you got an error that row size limit has reached while customizing your DocType. To\nbe sure that there aren't any ghost columns, or old hidden fields taking up the space, you\ncan be sure by running\nbench --site {site} trim-tables --dry-run",
