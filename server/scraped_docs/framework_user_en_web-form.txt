Frappe provides an easy way to generate forms for your website with very little
configuration. These forms may be public (anyone can fill them up) or can be
configured to require login.

Standard Web Forms

If you check the "Is Standard" checkbox, a new folder will be created in the
module of the Web Form. In this folder, you will see a .py and .js file
that you can use to configure the web form. These files need to be checked into
version control with your custom app. You can install this app on any site and
it will have this web form installed.

 Is Standard field will only be visible when you are in developer mode.
