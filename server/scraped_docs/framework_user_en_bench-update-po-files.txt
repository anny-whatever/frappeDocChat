Usage

bench update-po-files [OPTIONS]

Prerequisites

Existing POT file and PO files in your app's locale directory.

Description

This command syncs your existing translation files with the existing POT file, which holds all translatable strings. It removes all outdated strings and adds new ones.

You'll want to run this command after you regenerated the POT file with translatable strings. In case you are using a dedicated platform for translation management, the platform might also take care of this step for you, so that you won't need this command.

Options

--app This parameter let's you specify an app, in case you want to update the PO files for one app only. Default: all apps.
--locale This parameter let's you specify a locale, in case you want to update the PO file for one locale only. Default: all locales.

Examples

Sync ERPNext's translatable strings with the file holding german translations.

bench update-po-files --app erpnext --locale de

This reads translations from apps/erpnext/erpnext/locale/de.po and translatable strings from apps/erpnext/erpnext/locale/main.pot. The result is saved to apps/erpnext/erpnext/locale/de.po.
