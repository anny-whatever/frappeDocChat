  "content": "Query Reports are reports that can be generated using a single SQL query. The\nquery can be simple or complex as long as it generates columns and records.\nThese reports can only be created by a System Manager and are stored in the database.\n\nTo create a Query Report, type \"new report\" in the awesomebar and hit enter.\n\nSet Report Type as \"Query Report\"\nSet the Reference DocType - Users that have access to the Reference DocType will have access to the report\nSet the Module - The report will appear in the \"Custom Reports\" section of the module.\nWrite your query\n\n If you set Standard as \"Yes\" and Developer Mode is enabled, then a JSON file\n will be generated which you will have to check in to your version control. You\n should do this only if you want to bundle Query Reports with your app. The\n Module will decide where the JSON file will go.\n\nColumns and Filters\n\n Added in Version 13\n\nYou can configure the columns and filters in the Report document. Here you can set the label, width, format (fieldtype) for the columns and filters.\n\nFilters can be used as formatting variables in the query. For example a filters of type customer can be used as %(customer)s in the query.\n\nExample\n\nSELECT\n name, creation, production_item, qty, produced_qty, company\nFROM\n `tabWork Order`\nWHERE\n docstatus=1\n AND ifnull(produced_qty,0) < qty\n\nFormatting columns (Old Style)\n\nAlternatively columns can also be formatted by specifying the label of the column in a particular format: {label}:{optional fieldtype}{optional /}{optional options}:{optional width}\n\nIf you have configured the fields and columns in the Report itself, you do not need to use this style.\n\nExample (Old Style)\n\nHere is what a query may look like:\n\nSELECT\n `tabWork Order`.name as \"Work Order:Link/Work Order:200\",\n `tabWork Order`.creation as \"Date:Date:120\",\n `tabWork Order`.production_item as \"Item:Link/Item:150\",\n `tabWork Order`.qty as \"To Produce:Int:100\",\n `tabWork Order`.produced_qty as \"Produced:Int:100\",\n `tabWork Order`.company as \"Company:Link/Company:\"\nFROM\n `tabWork Order`\nWHERE\n `tabWork Order`.docstatus=1\n AND ifnull(`tabWork Order`.produced_qty,0) < `tabWork Order`.qty\n AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT name from `tabStock Entry` where work_order =`tabWork Order`.name)\n\nIf you notice there is a special syntax for each column, we use this information\nto format the Report View.\n\nFor example: The first column Work Order:Link/Work Order:200 will be rendered\nas a Link Field with the DocType Work Order and the column width would be 200px.\n\nQuery Report View",
