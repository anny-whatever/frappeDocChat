Usage

bench trim-database [OPTIONS]

Description

Deleting DocTypes from the list view may not delete their corresponding tables from
the database. Migrations may leave ghost tables in your Site Database at times. This
 may be done for the sake of redundancy, for recovery in case your data is corrupted
 or lost, or simply, in cases of human error.

This command drops any tables that seem to be remnants like the above mentioned. It will
attempt a partial backup of the tables before dropping them. In case, these tables were
required, and were dropped errenously, you can restore them in your site's database using
the partial-restore command.

Options

--format, -f Set output format. Available options are JSON and Table. Defaults to Table.

Flags

--dry-run Show what would be deleted.
--no-backup Do not backup the site prior to the trimming.

Examples

Want to build over this command and need the data to be machine parsable? Set the output
--format to json.
