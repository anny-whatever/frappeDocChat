  "content": "Your custom app can automatically add Custom Fields to DocTypes outside of your app when it is installed to a new site.\n\nTo do this, add the new custom fields that your app requires, using the Frappe web application.\n\nIn your hooks.py file, add \"Custom Fields\"\n\nfixtures = [\"Custom Field\"]\n\nExport fixtures before you commit your app with:\n\n$ bench --site mysite export-fixtures\n\nThis will create a new folder called fixtures in your app folder and a .csv or .json file will be created with the definition of the custom fields you added.\n\nThis file will be automatically imported when the app is installed in a new site or updated via bench update.\n\nNote: You can also add single DocTypes like \"Website Settings\" as fixtures",
