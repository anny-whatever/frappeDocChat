  "content": "Usage\n\nbench migrate-csv-to-po [OPTIONS]\n\nPrerequisites\n\nPlease make sure your app has a POT file already. If not, you can generate one.\n\nDescription\n\nThis command reads in your existing translations from CSV files, matches them with the existing POT file and writes the result into[app_module]/locale/[locale].po.\n\nYou will only need this command while switching from the old translation system to the new one.\n\nOptions\n\n--app This parameter let's you specify an app, in case you want to migrate translations for one app only. Default: all apps.\n--locale This parameter let's you specify a locale, in case you want to migrate translations for one locale only. Default: all locales.\n\nExamples\n\nMigrate ERPNext's german translations from CSV to PO.\n\nbench migrate-csv-to-po --app erpnext --locale de\n\nThis reads translations from apps/erpnext/erpnext/translations/de.csv and translatable strings from apps/erpnext/erpnext/locale/main.pot. The result is saved to apps/erpnext/erpnext/locale/de.po. If you're happy with the result, you can now delete the CSV file.",
