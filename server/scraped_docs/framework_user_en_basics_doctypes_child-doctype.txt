Up until now we have only seen DocTypes that can have a single value for each field.
However, there might be a need for storing multiple records against one record, also
known as many-to-one relationships. A Child DocType is doctype which can only be linked
to a parent DocType. To make a Child DocType make sure to check Is Child Table while
creating the doctype.

To link a Child Doctype to its parent, add another row in Parent Doctype with field
type Table and options as Child Table.

Child DocType records are directly attached to the parent doc.

>>> person = frappe.get_doc('Person', '000001')
>>> person.as_dict()
{
 'first_name': 'John',
 'last_name': 'Doe',
 'qualifications': [
 {'title': 'Frontend Architect', 'year': '2017'},
 {'title': 'DevOps Engineer', 'year': '2016'},
 ]
}

Child Properties

Child documents have special properties that define their relationship to their parent :

parent: name of the parent.
parenttype: DocType of the parent.
parentfield: Field in the parent that links this child to it.
idx: Sequence (row).
