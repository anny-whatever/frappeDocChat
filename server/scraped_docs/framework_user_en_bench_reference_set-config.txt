Usage

bench set-config [OPTIONS] KEY VALUE

Description

Bench provides a wrapper command to insert or update values in the site config
files. You can update values in your site's site_config.json, along with the
bench directory's common_site_config.json through the same command.

To read more about site configuration and understanding key precedence, refer to
the docs here.

Flags

-g, --global Set value in the Bench's Common Site Config
-p, --parse Parse given value instead of string. You can use this to set
dict and list values. This was --as-dict in earlier versions.

Examples

Enable tests for given site.

bench --site {site} set-config allow_tests true

Enable tests for all sites.

bench --site all set-config allow_tests true

Using the above command, each site's site_config.json will have the
key-value "allow_tests": true. This allows running tests on all of the
sites.

bench set-config -g allow_tests true

Using the above command, the bench's common_site_config.json will have the
key-value "allow_tests": true. This will allow each site on the bench to
have tests run unless they have a value defined for the sma in their
site_config.json.
Set a dict value in your site's frappe.conf

bench --site {site} set-config backup '{"includes": ["Not", "ToDo"]}' --parse

You can now access the list in code as frappe.conf.backup.get("includes").
