This command is added in Version 14, and supports only MariaDB

Usage

bench transform-database [OPTIONS] table

Description

The transform-database command allows you to manage the settings of your site's tables. At this point, you can switch engines and row_format settings for select tables on your site database.

 MariaDB 10.6 deprecated the COMPRESSED ROW_FORMAT which was Frappe's default option for a very long time. This command was added to handle upgrades to later versions of MariaDB. For more information on this, refer to the PR.

Options

--table Comma separated name of tables to convert. To convert all tables, pass 'all' [required]
--engine Choice of storage engine for said table(s). Options available are InnoDB and MyISAM.
--row_format Set ROW_FORMAT parameter for said table(s). Options available are DYNAMIC, COMPACT, REDUNDANT, COMPRESSED.

Flags

failfast Exit on first failure occurred

Examples

Consider a scenario where you'd want to change the engine of a table "tabAccess Record" to MyISAM. You may want to do this if it's a log table that's dealing with huge volumes of writes and very little reads.

bench --site {site} transform-database --table 'tabAccess Record' --engine 'MyISAM'

You've upgraded MariaDB on your current server from 10.3 to 10.7 and you want to convert all the tables that used the COMPRESSED row_format to the new default, ie DYNAMIC. You'd want to run the following command.

bench --site {site} transform-database --table 'all' --row_format 'DYNAMIC'
