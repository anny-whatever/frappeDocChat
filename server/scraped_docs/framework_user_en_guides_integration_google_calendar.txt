Frappe provides an integration with Google Calendar in order for all users to synchronize their events.

Setup

In order to allow a synchronization with Google Calendar you need to connect to your application in Google Cloud Platform and then create an account for each of your users:

Create a new project on Google Cloud Platform and generate new OAuth 2.0 credentials
Add https://{yoursite} to Authorized JavaScript origins
Add https://{yoursite}?cmd=frappe.integrations.doctype.gcalendar_settings.gcalendar_settings.google_callback as an authorized redirect URI
Add your Client ID and Client Secret in the Gcalendar application: in "Modules>Integrations>Google Calendar>GCalendar Settings"

Once this step is successfully completed, each user can create their own account in Google Calendar > GCalendar Account.
They will be requested to authorize your Google application to access their calendar information and will then be redirected to a success page.

Features

Events synchronization from Frappe to GCalendar

All Events created in Frappe are created in Google Calendar.
Recurring Events are created as recurring events too.
You can optionally add a Google Meet conference link to the Event.
All participants (User email) will be added to the Event.

Events synchronization from GCalendar to Frappe

Events created in Google Calendar are created in Frappe.
Events updated in Google Calendar are updated in Frappe.

The synchronization module follows Frappe's authorization rule: An event will be only synchronized if it is public or if the user is the owner.

Limitations

Currently, if an instance of a recurring event is cancelled in Google Calendar, this change will not be reflected in Frappe.
