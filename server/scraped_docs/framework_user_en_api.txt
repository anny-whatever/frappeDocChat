Frappe aims to achieve minimum cognitive load for its users. Hence, you can find
the most used methods and utilities in the frappe namespace itself. It's the
only import you need (most of the time) in a Python file.

Frappe attaches itself to the window object under the frappe namespace. You
will find most of the Client API under the frappe object. All of these methods
are only available inside the Desk. A good way to explore these APIs is from the
browser console.
