A Single DocType is a DocType that has only one instance in the database. It is useful
for persisting things like System Settings, which don't make sense to have multiple
records.

>>> settings = frappe.get_doc('System Settings')
>>> settings.notification_frequency
'Daily'

Schema

Single DocTypes are stored in the tabSingles table in the database, with each property having its own record.

Columns:

doctype
field
value
