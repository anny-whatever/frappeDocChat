Workspace is the first page you land on when you log in.
It also has a dedicated sidebar where you can rearrange the workspace position according to your convenience.

The workspace itself is a tool to build user-specific pages. 
It comes with some standard workspaces which are listed in the PUBLIC section in the sidebar and are visible to all users.
You can also create private workspaces which will only be visible to the logged-in user(owner) in the MY WORKSPACES section. 

Let's build one and check out some cool features.

It will only be visible to the currently logged-in user(owner) under the MY WORKSPACES section

All the standard workspaces comes under PUBLIC section.

 Only users with Workspace Manager Role can create, edit or delete public workspaces

Customization

Workspace has two modes Read Only Mode and Edit Mode. You can start customizing your workspace by clicking on the Edit button.
Customizing Workspaces and Customizing Workspace Page are two different things.

 Adding new blocks from the workspace document will not work as the new workspace doesn't know exactly where to add that block (at which position). You can update the existing blocks from the workspace document but it is not recommended either. The best practice would be to use the new workspace builder UI to do all kinds of customization.
