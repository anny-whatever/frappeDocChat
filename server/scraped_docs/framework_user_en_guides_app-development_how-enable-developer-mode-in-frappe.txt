When you are in application design mode and you want the changes in your DocTypes, Reports etc to affect the app repository, you must be in Developer Mode.

To enable developer mode, update the site_config.json file of your site in the sites folder:

frappe-bench/sites/{your site}/site_config.json

Inside the frappe-bench folder, run

bench set-config -g developer_mode 1

OR, manually, write "developer_mode": 1 inside the { .. } of site_config.json

{
 "developer_mode": 1,
 ...
}

After setting developer mode, clear the cache:

bench --site {your site} clear-cache

Some apps might require additional dependencies to build and test in development mode. Install them using bench:

bench setup requirements --dev
