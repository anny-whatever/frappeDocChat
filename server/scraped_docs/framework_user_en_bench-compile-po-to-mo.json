  "content": "Usage\n\nbench compile-po-to-mo [OPTIONS]\n\nPrerequisites\n\nExisting PO files in your app's locale directory, holding translations for at least one language.\n\nDescription\n\nThe PO files hold translations in human-readable format. Before they can be used by the application, translations need to be compiled to binary files (ending with MO). The binary file is stored in the sites/assets/locale folder of your bench.\n\nFor efficiency, this skips compilation if there are existing MO files which are newer than the PO files.\n\nThis command is automatically executed along with bench build and bench update. You can run it explicitly in your development environment, when you just added some translations and want to see the result in the UI.\n\nOptions\n\n--app This parameter let's you specify an app, in case you want to update the PO files for one app only. Default: all apps.\n--locale This parameter let's you specify a locale, in case you want to update the PO file for one locale only. Default: all locales.\n--force Force re-compilation, even if the PO files didn't change.\n\nExamples\n\nCompile ERPNext's german translations.\n\nbench compile-po-to-mo --app erpnext --locale de\n\nThis reads translations from apps/erpnext/erpnext/locale/de.po and compiles them to binary. The result is saved to sites/assets/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/erpnext.mo.",
