  "content": "To trigger an event when a row from a Child Table has been deleted (when user clicks on delete button), you need to add a handler the fieldname_remove event to Child Table, where fieldname is the fieldname of the Child Table in Parent Table declaration.\n\nFor example:\n\nAssuming that your parent DocType is named Item has a Table Field linked to Item Color DocType with decloration name color.\n\nIn order to \"catch\" the delete event:\n\nfrappe.ui.form.on('Item Color', {\n color_remove: function(frm) {\n // You code here\n // If you console.log(frm.doc.color) you will get the remaining color list\n }\n);\n\nThe same process is used to trigger the add event (when user clicks on add row button):\n\nfrappe.ui.form.on('Item Color', {\n color_remove: function(frm) {\n // You code here\n // If you console.log(frm.doc.color) you will get the remaining color list\n },\n color_add: function(frm) {}\n});\n\nNotice that the handling is be made on Child DocType Table form.ui.on and not on Parent Doctype so a minimal full example is:\n\nfrappe.ui.form.on('Item',{\n // Your client side handling for Item\n});\n\nfrappe.ui.form.on('Item Color', {\n color_remove: function(frm) {\n // Deleting is triggered here\n }\n);\n\nHandlers are:\n\nfieldname_add\nfieldname_move\nfieldname_before_remove\nfieldname_remove",
